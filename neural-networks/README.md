# Neural Networks in Solid

A project undertaken by the [Artificial Intelligence Panel](https://github.com/solid/artificial-intelligence-panel).

## Goal

The aim of this is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a mechanism for how a data pod can store and use neural networks.

## Milestones

1. Write [use cases](use-cases.md)
2. Write [hypothesis](hypothesis.md) for intended approach
3. Create prototype *(with supporting documentation in refined hypothesis)*
4. Write and submit candidate proposal to specification
