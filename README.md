# Solid Artificial Intelligence Panel

Focused on developing standards for extending Solid with capabilities in Artificial Intelligence.

Areas of interest include virtual assistants, neural networks, vocabularies, shapes, footprints, and the mechanisms through which these things (and others) work together to achieve artificial intelligence. 
The goal should not be just to emulate the latest and greatest AI from big companies, but to build useful things compatible with the Solid philosophy of personal control, and build them in an open and transparent way.
